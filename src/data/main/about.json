I'm currently a senior at New York University, where I study data science and journalism.\n\nI recently finished an internship at CoinDesk, where — 11 time zones away from its Manhattan office — I created graphics and helped engineers integrate D3 into their CMS. Before that, I was automating audience dashboards with Python and D3 for Malcolm Gladwell's podcast company, Pushkin Industries, as its first data-science intern. Nowadays, I'm [introducing D3](https://observablehq.com/@duynguyen1678/xin-chao-d3-js) to Vietnamese journalists and volunteering in [front-end development](https://covidtracking.com/about-data/visualization-guide) for the COVID Tracking Project."

Or, if I'm in Hanoi, embarassing my high-school [teammates](https://urbanisthanoi.com/hanoi-culture/16559-field-of-dreams-the-history-and-future-of-baseball-in-vietnam) with my subpar performance as a shortstop."
