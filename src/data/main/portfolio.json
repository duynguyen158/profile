I'll use this same procedure for every interpolation technique. To produce a polygon that enclose each input (2) or sampled (3) point, I used `d3.geoVoronoi` (here's a [tutorial](https://observablehq.com/@fil/d3-geo-voronoi-and-gridded-data)). *What would happen if I applied `tricontour` directly on the input values?*"
